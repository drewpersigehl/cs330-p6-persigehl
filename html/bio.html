          <p>Hi, I'm Drew. Welcome to my website. I was born in Omaha, Nebraska on March 29th 2001. In 2007 I moved to Bennington, Nebraska. I attended Bennington High School and graduated in 2019. Then, I started attending Northwestern University where I am a current fourth-year student. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Science and a certificate in design. Some of my interests are golfing, running, and singing.</p>
